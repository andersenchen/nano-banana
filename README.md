## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 20.x or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account and project
- A [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) project with OAuth credentials
- A [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) API key for Gemini

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd nano-banana
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Update `.env.local` with your credentials:

   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   # Get these from: https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

   # Google OAuth for app
   # Get from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id

   # Google Gemini AI
   # Get from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key

   # Google OAuth credentials for Supabase (get from Google Cloud Console)
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   ```

4. **Set up Supabase**

   The project includes database migrations in `supabase/migrations/`. Apply them using the Supabase CLI:

   ```bash
   # Install Supabase CLI if you haven't already
   npm install -g supabase

   # Link to your project
   supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref

   # Run migrations
   supabase db push
   ```

5. **Configure Google OAuth in Supabase**

   In your Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to Authentication > Providers
   - Enable Google provider
   - Add your Google Client ID and Client Secret
   - Add authorized redirect URIs in Google Console

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The development server uses Turbopack for faster builds and hot module replacement.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## How It Works

### AI Image Transformation

The app uses Google's Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash) with image capabilities to transform uploaded images based on text prompts. Images are processed server-side and automatically saved to your gallery.

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js app is to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository in Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

Vercel will automatically:
- Build your Next.js application
- Set up continuous deployment from your Git repository
- Provide a production URL
- Handle serverless functions for API routes

### Environment Variables for Production

Make sure to add all environment variables from `.env.local` to your production environment (Vercel, Railway, etc.)

### Supabase Production Setup

1. Ensure all migrations are applied to your production database
2. Configure storage buckets with proper access policies
3. Set up authentication providers in Supabase dashboard
4. Add your production URLs to allowed redirect URLs

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
