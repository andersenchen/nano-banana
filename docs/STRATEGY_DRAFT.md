## The Final State: User Journey

```
Sarah discovers a meme on the feed
  → sees it was remixed from Jake's original
  → traces back through 3 transformations
  → finds the "vintage poster" style she loves

Sarah uploads her dog photo
  → applies Jake's "vintage poster" style
  → adds her own twist with a text overlay
  → publishes with automatic attribution to Jake

Jake gets notified
  → sees his style being used
  → earns credits from the transformation
  → Sarah's version shows in his "remix tree"

Maria discovers Sarah's dog poster
  → clicks through to see the style origin
  → follows both Sarah and Jake
  → remixes Sarah's version for her cat

Three months later:
  → Jake's "vintage poster" style has 847 uses
  → He's earning $340/month in passive style royalties
  → A brand licenses it for a campaign
  → The remix graph shows 12 derivative styles
  → His reputation score puts him in top 50 creators

The graph knows:
  → Which styles work with which content types
  → Which creators collaborate well together
  → Which remix chains go viral
  → What new styles are emerging
  → Where creativity is heading next
```

This is what we're building: **Git for creativity meets TikTok's feed meets a marketplace for creative DNA.**

Every transformation creates an edge in the graph. Every attribution creates provenance. Every remix creates network effects. Every style becomes an asset.

## What we're actually building

We're building a social network for attributed AI creativity. Right now we look like a meme maker—just a wrapper around Gemini's image transformation API. And that's fine. But the real play is the graph of creative derivation underneath.

Think Git for visual creativity, meets TikTok's feed, meets a marketplace for creative styles.

Here's the thing: the transformation itself will get commoditized. The creative graph won't.

### Why now

Three things happening at once:

1. AI generation is commoditizing fast (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic all racing to zero)
2. Remix culture already dominates social (TikTok's engagement is 5x Instagram's)
3. Attribution is becoming legally required (EU AI Act, Adobe Content Credentials, C2PA)

The opportunity is in attribution infrastructure for AI creativity. Winners won't have the best generators—they'll own discovery, provenance, and collaboration.

We need to own the attribution graph before generation becomes completely free.

## The Market

### Where the gaps are

Look at what exists:

- Midjourney has the best image generation but zero collaboration, no attribution, no remix
- Instagram and TikTok have remix culture at scale but no deep creative tools, just basic tagging
- OpenAI and Anthropic are building foundation models, not end-user products
- Adobe has professional creative tools but nothing AI-native, and no social layer

No one is building a social creative platform for AI-native content where attribution is the core mechanic.

### Why this will work

#### Remix features have already won

TikTok's engagement rate in 2025 is 2.5% vs Instagram's 0.5%. Duets and stitches show up in 19% of TikTok videos, and stitched videos get 2-3x more engagement than standalone content. Instagram saw this and copied with "Remix" in March 2021.

People want to create in dialogue with others, not alone. Collaborative creation is the engagement driver on the fastest-growing platforms.

If remix culture drives 5x engagement on video, why wouldn't it work for images? The behavior is proven. We're just applying it to a new medium.

#### Pure generation tools are hitting a ceiling

Google Whisk launched in December 2024 with image-to-image remixing. User feedback: "innovative BUT results inconsistent or generic." No memory, no consistency, no iteration path.

Midjourney in 2025 is still getting complaints on Reddit: "Incredibly bad at responding to exact descriptions" and "the more you define, the worse it gets." Still struggles with consistency, anatomy, control.

Meta Vibes launched in September 2025. Reception: "gang nobody wants this" and "AI slop." No provenance, no attribution, no creator connection.

Users are hitting the ceiling of pure generation. The technology improved but the experience didn't. You can't collaborate with a black box. You can't build on someone else's style if you can't discover it, attribute it, or remix it.

The next wave of AI creative tools won't be better generators—they'll be better systems for human creativity that use AI as infrastructure. Winners will solve discovery, attribution, and collaboration.

#### Attribution is becoming infrastructure

Regulatory pressure is building. EU AI Act (March 2025) mandates digital watermarking and metadata for AI content. TikTok adopted Content Credentials (C2PA standard) in May 2024. Adobe launched a free Content Authenticity web app in October 2024. The AI watermarking market is projected to go from $614M in 2025 to $2.96B in 2032.

Community backlash is real. r/Art bans AI-generated content outright. r/AntiAI grew from 50K to 500K members by 2025. Artist Ben Moran got falsely banned for "AI art" when he was just using Photoshop. Everyone's asking: "How do we know what's real?"

Attribution isn't optional anymore. It's becoming legally and socially required. Platforms that solve provenance early will own the standard.

Whoever owns the attribution graph becomes the credit bureau of AI creativity. That's infrastructure-level value.

#### Creator economy is professionalizing

The creator economy is going from $253B in 2025 to a projected $2.05T in 2035. Creator startups raised $767M in 2023-2024, up 49% year over year. Individual creators hold 58.7% market share.

The mentality is shifting from "do what you love" (2020-2024) to "build a sustainable creative business" (2025+).

What creators actually need:
- Long-term brand partnerships, not one-off deals
- IP ownership and licensing
- Analytics on what's working
- Revenue diversification across ads, subscriptions, licensing, marketplace

Current AI tools fail them on all of this. They can't prove a style is "theirs." Can't track if techniques are being copied. Can't monetize their creative process. Can't collaborate with proper attribution.

Creators are becoming businesses. They need business infrastructure. Current AI tools treat everyone as anonymous consumers, not creators with IP to protect and monetize.

The first AI creative platform that treats users as creators with intellectual property (not just prompters) unlocks the entire creator economy business model.

#### Incumbents can't or won't build this

Social platforms like Instagram and TikTok optimize for content consumption (watch time, ad views), broad entertainment (lowest common denominator), and fast iteration (24-hour lifecycles).

They can't build deep creative tools (too complex for core users), attribution infrastructure (threatens their content aggregation model), or creator-first business models (conflicts with advertiser revenue).

Proof: Instagram has had "Remix" for 4 years. It's still just a side-by-side video feature. No style extraction, no creative graph, no attribution beyond basic tags. They're not incentivized to go deeper.

AI companies won't either. Midjourney optimizes for image quality, not community. OpenAI and Anthropic are building foundation models, not end-user products. Runway and Stability are horizontal infrastructure, not vertical platforms.

No one is building a social creative platform for AI-native generation. Everyone's building generation engines OR social platforms. No one combines them with attribution as the connective tissue.

We're not competing with Instagram on distribution or OpenAI on model quality. We're building the category no one else can: attributed creative networks powered by AI infrastructure.

## The Product

### Starting with creative remixing

The first version is simple: upload images, describe transformations in natural language, share results with a creative community.

Why visual remixing as the entry point:

1. Starting with an existing image lowers the barrier. Users don't face the blank canvas problem.

2. Each creation has a parent. Every transformation implies "I saw X and made Y." Natural content propagation through remix chains. Discovery happens through derivation.

3. Transformations have clear before/after that makes quality and style immediately visible. This measurability enables everything downstream.

Why memes specifically:

Memes are the perfect trojan horse. Immediate utility with clear use cases. High-frequency, social, repeatable behavior that generates data density. Already part of remix culture so users understand derivation. Low-stakes experimentation that welcomes weird ideas.

We're not building a meme maker. We're using memes to train users on attributed, graph-based creativity. Once the behaviors are established, we expand to all visual content.

### The platform: visual creativity graph

What we're actually building is a platform that maps, indexes, and enables the entire creative derivation space for visual content.

#### The remix graph (network effects)

Every transformation creates an edge in the graph. Original image → transformation prompt → derived image. Which styles applied to which content. Which remix chains go viral. How creative patterns propagate.

After 10K transformations, we know which prompts work. After 100K, we know which styles resonate with which audiences. After 1M, we have a proprietary map of the entire visual remix space.

#### Creative DNA and attribution (data moat)

Each image carries creative provenance. Full derivation chain (A→B→C→D). Style signatures. Creator attribution that persists through remixes. Computational watermarking for AI content authenticity.

As AI content proliferates, provenance becomes valuable. We become the source of truth for "where did this come from" and "who created this style."

#### Style marketplace (creator economy)

Creators can package transformation patterns as reusable "styles." Earn when others use their styles. Build reputation for consistent creative voice. License style fingerprints to brands.

We move from one-off transformations to creative styles as products. Each new style increases value for all users. Economic incentive keeps quality creators in the ecosystem.

#### Intelligence layer (AI moat)

Our proprietary models learn what makes transformations successful (engagement, completion rate, remix rate). Style compatibility (which styles work on which content). Audience-style matching (who will love what). Trend prediction (which creative patterns are emerging).

This is data only we have. No foundation model provider can replicate it because it requires observing millions of creative decisions in context.

---

## Defensibility

### The core bet

We're betting that creativity is inherently social and attributed, not atomic and anonymous.

Single-shot generation (Midjourney, DALL-E) treats each creation as isolated. But real creativity is built on what came before (remixing), shared with others (social), attributed to creators (reputation), and part of a larger cultural conversation (context).

By building for creativity-as-graph instead of creativity-as-transaction, we create network effects pure generation tools can never achieve.

### Defensibility layers

1. Data moat: proprietary remix graph and engagement data
2. Network effects: each creator and creation increases platform value
3. Creator lock-in: reputation and earnings tied to our platform
4. Intelligence layer: ML models trained on our unique dataset
5. Protocol position: if we become the standard for attribution, we're infrastructure

### Economic moat

Foundation model providers optimize for API usage. Their incentive is to make generation cheap and ubiquitous.

We optimize for creative economy GMV. Our incentive is to maximize creator earnings and brand licensing fees.

These incentives are orthogonal, not competing. As generation becomes free, creative curation, discovery, and attribution become more valuable. We operate at the layer above the commodity.

### Three horizons of AI defensibility

Horizon 1: Model differentiation (6-12 months)
- "Our prompt chain is better"
- Easily replicated
- Useful for initial traction only

Horizon 2: Data and learning (1-3 years)
- "Our model learned from proprietary usage data"
- Harder to replicate (requires time + users)
- Buys time to build Horizon 3

Horizon 3: Network effects and lock-in (3+ years)
- "Our platform has irreplaceable relationships/data/standards"
- Can't be replicated even with unlimited resources
- Durable competitive advantage

Our strategy: launch on Horizon 1, build Horizon 2 immediately, race to Horizon 3 before commoditization kills Horizon 1.

## Metrics

### North star: creative graph depth

Average number of nodes in the derivation chain for remixed content.

Shallow graphs (A→B) mean we're just a tool. Deep graphs (A→B→C→D→E) mean we're a creative network. This metric captures network effects.

### Supporting metrics

Product-market fit:
- Week-over-week active creator growth
- % of uploads that get remixed
- Creator retention

Network effects:
- Remix chain depth
- Cross-creator collaboration rate
- Style reuse across user base

Business:
- Creator GMV (marketplace + licensing)
- Enterprise API revenue
- User LTV / CAC ratio

Moat strength:
- Size of proprietary dataset (transformation + engagement pairs)
- Third-party API adoption rate
- % of internet's AI visual content with our attribution

## When commoditization comes

### The scenario

OpenAI announces GPT-5 with vision. A single API call does what our entire prompt chain did. Our "magic" is gone.

### The response

"We knew this was coming. Our product was never the transformation API. That was just the hook. We built a creative network. The API becoming free doesn't threaten us—it accelerates us."

Crisis management starts with showing we're not in crisis. We're exactly where we planned to be.

Turn their feature launch into our feature launch. Move the conversation from "transformation quality" to "style discovery," "creative community," and "attribution infrastructure."

### How we respond

Commoditization of generation is our cue to accelerate up the value chain:

Layer 1: Higher-order features
- Style application from our graph to any image
- The free API makes this economically viable at scale
- What was our core feature becomes the commodity layer beneath a higher-order feature

Layer 2: Network effects
- Discovery feed for creative inspiration
- Surfaces remix chains algorithmically
- Proprietary understanding creates discovery experience no one else can match

Layer 3: Creator economy
- Show creators which styles are being used, what's trending, earnings
- Reasons to stay invested beyond transformation quality
- Monetization through marketplace and licensing

Layer 4: Platform infrastructure
- Developer API accessing our style marketplace
- Brand partnerships licensing creator styles
- Open attribution protocol
- Intelligence layer (compatibility scoring, trend prediction)

### Team posture

Radical transparency: share full strategy with entire team. Everyone understands why we're making each decision.

Preparation over panic: "we planned for this" is calming. This wasn't a surprise.

Clarity of mission: we're not changing direction. We're articulating what we were always building.

Celebrate the pivot: this isn't failure, it's validation. Technology is moving in the direction we predicted.

## Risks

### What could kill this

**Users don't care about attribution**

If anonymous AI slop is fine, our moat doesn't matter.

Counterargument: r/Art banning AI, 500K-member r/AntiAI, EU mandating attribution, Adobe launching Content Credentials. The trend is clear.

But what if attribution is only valued by a vocal minority?

Then attribution becomes our differentiator for the high-value creator segment while remaining invisible to casual users. Attribution doesn't have to be the product—it can be infrastructure that enables other features (discovery, collaboration, monetization). The utility case doesn't require ethical buy-in.

**Remix behavior doesn't transfer to static images**

Video remixing works; image remixing is unproven.

Google Whisk validates demand for image remixing, just not their execution. But Whisk failed despite Google's resources. Maybe the behavior doesn't actually transfer?

Whisk failed on consistency and output quality, not on demand. User feedback was "innovative BUT results inconsistent." The desire is there; the execution wasn't. Also: meme culture is literally built on image remixing. We're digitizing an existing behavior, not creating new demand.

**A big platform copies us**

Instagram launches "Style Remix" with 2B users.

They've had 4 years and haven't. Their incentives don't align. Attribution threatens their aggregation model. But if we prove the market, they could copy overnight with unlimited resources.

Let them. By the time they move, we have the graph, the creator relationships, and the data. Instagram can build features; they can't replicate history. They optimize for engagement, not creator economics. If we own creator loyalty through revenue share, their distribution advantage weakens. Worst case: acquisition target at significant valuation.

**We're too early**

Creators aren't ready to think about AI-native IP.

Creator economy funding is up 49% YoY. Professionalization is happening now. But professionalization doesn't mean they understand AI IP. The mental models don't exist yet.

Then we define the mental models. This is a category creation opportunity. First mover advantage in defining "what is a style," "how to price it," "what remix rights mean." We become the standard because we're first. Education is hard but defensible.

**Network effects don't materialize**

Users don't remix or build on each other's work.

TikTok proved remix culture works. We need to nail the UX for images. But TikTok had algorithmic distribution. Without that, why would anyone remix?

We build algorithmic distribution too. But more importantly: TikTok's remix features work because they give creators exposure. If remixing someone popular surfaces you to their audience, the incentive exists. Attribution isn't just ethical—it's growth strategy. Every remix is a collaboration that benefits both parties.

**Commoditization comes even faster than expected**

The transformation AND the remix graph infrastructure get commoditized simultaneously.

Community and reputation can't be forked. Like GitHub: even when Git is free, GitHub has the network. But GitHub had network effects before Git was commoditized. If we're racing to build the graph while the tech commoditizes, we might not get there in time.

This is the real risk. Speed-to-network-effects is the only metric that matters early. If we don't hit critical mass on remix behavior before someone with more resources decides to compete, we lose. The mitigation is singular focus: everything serves getting to self-sustaining remix chains as fast as possible. Cut any feature that doesn't directly create network effects.

### Assessment

This is high-risk but smart risk.

Every assumption has a validation signal. Every bet has a proxy metric. We're not hoping users will behave differently—we're betting they'll bring existing behaviors to a new medium.

We're not asking anyone to believe AI image generation will be big (already true), that remix culture works (TikTok proved it), or that creators want attribution (Adobe and EU proved it).

We're asking: when you combine these three validated trends—cheap generation, remix behavior, and mandatory attribution—does the emergent platform equal a social network for attributed creativity?

That's not a wild bet.

## Appendix

### Aggregation theory for AI products

Just as Uber didn't win by having the best dispatch algorithm (commoditized), AI products won't win by having the best model (will commoditize).

They win by aggregating users, data, transactions, relationships.

The model is distribution leverage. The aggregated network is the value.

### Unbundling and rebundling

AI unbundles complex workflows into simple API calls. But humans still need discovery ("what should I create?"), context ("what's the cultural conversation?"), attribution ("who made this?"), community ("who shares my taste?"), and curation ("what's actually good?").

The rebundling opportunity is providing these human needs around the commoditized AI capability.

We're not in the transformation business. We're in the creative context business.

### Pitching this

Start with the problem:

"Show me your creative process in Midjourney."
[They show Discord screenshots, random generations, lost prompts]
"Now show me how you built on someone else's style."
[Silence]
"These are single-player tools in a multiplayer world."

The timing:

Three things are converging. Technology: image generation is commoditizing. Behavior: remix culture dominates social. Regulation: attribution is becoming mandatory.

When three tailwinds align, the question isn't if someone builds this. It's who.

Why us:

We're early. First-mover on the attribution graph. We're focused—not distracted by model training or horizontal infrastructure. We understand the game: this is network effects from day one.

We're not building a better Midjourney. We're building what comes after generation is free.

The proof:

We don't need to guess. TikTok proved remix culture drives 5x engagement. Adobe proved creators want Content Credentials. EU proved attribution will be mandatory. Midjourney's frustration proves pure generation hit a wall.

Every assumption has a validation signal. We're not inventing demand—we're connecting proven demand to a new solution.

The vision:

In 18 months, when someone sees an amazing AI image and asks "how was this made?"—where will they go?

Right now: nowhere. The information doesn't exist.

We're building the answer to that question. Whoever owns that answer owns the creative graph of AI-native content.

---

## Conclusion

The best AI product strategies treat the model as infrastructure, not the product.

Our current implementation—a thin wrapper around Gemini's image API—is a feature, not a moat. But it's the right first feature because it establishes the core behavior (remix culture), generates the data we need (the creative graph), and attracts the users we want (creators, not consumers).

When commoditization comes—and it will—we won't scramble. We'll accelerate. The value was never in the API call. It's in the network of creativity we're building around it.

*This is a living document. As we learn from users, competitors, and technology shifts, we'll update our approach. The principles stay constant: build for network effects, create data moats, and always be one layer above the commodity.*
